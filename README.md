## How to use the mass delete mod ? 

Go into the build option to lay foundation, determine the zone with + or - , it will create an invisible square around the center of the foundation area. 
Then press the jump key ( probably space bar for you ) and enjoy ! 

Some limitations : 
    - the height is limited by the radius of the invisible sphere for now. you will still have to remove some stuff manually but it should be only on extreme height situation.
    - If you don't have space in inventory you loose what's deleted, be carefull ! 

## How much systems can you generate ? 

You can slide the number of system up to 1024 instead of 64. Be carefull if your pc is slow ^^ 
---> everything past 255 is experimental ! Test it at your own risk :)
