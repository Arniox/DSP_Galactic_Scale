# DSP Touhma Plugins

##How to Install :

First Install Bepinex in your game folder : https://bepinex.github.io/bepinex_docs/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html?tabs=tabid-win
Then Download the latest DLL of the mod : https://github.com/Touhma/DSP_Plugins/releases

And add it in depinex plugins folder in your game : steamapps\common\Dyson Sphere Program\BepInEx\plugins

Launch the game and you should be all set ! 

## How to use the mass delete mod ? 

Go into the build option to lay foundation, determine the zone with + or - , it will create an invisible square around the center of the foundation area. 
Then press the jump key ( probably space bar for you ) and enjoy ! 

Some limitations : 
    - the height is limited by the radius of the invisible sphere for now. you will still have to remove some stuff manually but it should be only on extreme height situation.
    - If you don't have space in inventory you loose what's deleted, be carefull ! 

## How much systems can you generate ? 

I added a piece of code inspired from the plugin of ragzilla#0001 from the discord of DSP. So all credit to him for the piece of code. 
You can slide the number of system up to 255 instead of 64. Be carefull if your pc is slow ^^
