## How to use galactic-scale ?  

### Map Size :

You can slide the number of system up to 1024 ( by default ) instead of 64. Be carefull if your pc is slow ^^ ---> everything past 64 is experimental ! Test it at your own risk :) 

#### Config Available :

Edit the file here : %gamefolder%\Dyson Sphere Program\BepInEx\config\touhma.dsp.plugins.galactic-scale.cfg

#### Limitations :

Although you can put more than 1024 stars in the config file the slider will get stuck on a number between 1024 & 1300 depending on the seed you are using.
